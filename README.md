# Readme generator

## Description
- this is a readme generator that creates a readme based on user input in the command line interface with inquirer js
## Details
- Once the js file is open with node, the user is ran through a series of promps that have respective sections on the readme that is being generated. Each input is added to the readme and once the user is done the readme is created in the application directory.

## What it solves
- The readme generator expedites creation of readme files because the sections are already made and it is allready formatted for markdown for the user.
## What i learned
- i learned how to use inqirer for both input values and choice values. The choice values have if statments checking for their respective liscences if the input has the liscence it is changed to the badge variable and added to the top of the readme.
